# Bennett_project
The project would take up the data of movement of mobile phone holders from the areas of high-risk to the areas of low risks or vice-versa. 
The project would require some basic information like the actual mobile phone users registered in a specific area, and then the differentiation between areas according to the ISD codes. 
The project would then require run-time dynamic information of moving of humans from one area to another, making humans as sensors to predict how the virus can travel 
from those areas where there is infection in almost all humans to those areas where there is either zero or very less infected persons are there. 
The project would help to impose restrictions from high-risk areas to low-risk areas, by predicting the probable spread well in advance. 
As per the current need of finding out the probable carriers of the virus, my project would try to solve the problem by restricting the movement of humans 
from high risk zones to low risk zones.
If we’re able to track the movement of humans or simply can check the movement of phone numbers of one area to another area,
we can alert the authorities about the probable spread in low risk areas too. 
Also, if allowed, we can take the data from the government’s Arogya Setu, to simply refrain movement of any identified person of the virus to move from his 
zone/area to any other zone/area. This will help in flattening the curve, and ultimately breaking the chain.
